# Machine Learning Prediction Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects focused on prediction and forecasting** using real-world datasets. The projects demonstrate how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced ML models (especially **XGBoost**) can be applied to solve practical problems such as **weather forecasting, sales prediction, and medical sales analysis**.

The goal of this project is to show **end-to-end ML workflows**: from data cleaning and exploration to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Weather Outcome Prediction
**Objective:**
Predict future weather outcomes (such as temperature trends, rainfall occurrence, or weather conditions) based on historical weather data.

**Key Tasks:**
- Date & time feature engineering (Year, Month, Day, Week)
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning for prediction

**Use Case:**
- Climate trend analysis
- Weather-based decision making (agriculture, planning, logistics)
